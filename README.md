# Unexpected summit

Planing repository for the summit.

Feel free to change the files in the repository directly on master.

There is some information on the earlier planing issue that can be found [here](https://github.com/unexpectedjs/unexpected/issues/337). I migrated most of it over into the [discussion](#discussion) section.

# Discussion

- Output
  Unexpected provides extremely high quality output that usefully describes failures and critically is helpful in diagnosing/correcting problems. That said, it is probably fair to say we’ve erred on the side of outputting more (absolutely the correct default) but that this has been strained in a few cases dealing with huge amounts of data or large objects etc.

  _Discuss changes and/or specific rules around the output we generate._

- Context
  Our flexible plugin APIs have allowed extensins of growing complexity, many of which modify their environment (unexpected-fs, unexpected-mitm, unexpected-mxhr). While these assertions work well individually, issues arise for composition and inspecting the changed environment (unexpected-couchdb) requires complex one off solutions. In addition, a number plugins that provide assertions of ‘local system state’ would benefit from such support (e.g. unexpected-event).

  _Discuss context as a generic API to address these use-cases._

- Plugin versioning
  The Unexpected plugin system was designed primarily for node projects. While we have been able to enforce various package.json conventions that avoid versioning issues, static builds of Unexpected plugins for use within the browser can cause problems when they share underlying dependencies.

  [There is a issue on the subject as well](https://github.com/unexpectedjs/unexpected/issues/334).

  _Discuss strategies for isolating plugin internals from end-user test suites._

- Challenges running tests
  Unexpected integrates with existing test running infrastructure through the assertion raising mechanism. However Unexpected would otherwise be able to give much more useful output for smaller chunks of failing tests, this is becoming a limitation. In addition, a large amount of complexity exists in the implementation supporting synchronous throws and also creates the plugin author footgun requiring an addition level of `expect.promise(function () { … })` wrapping.

  _Discuss alternative test running strategies._

- Future of middle-rocket assertions
  [See this issue](https://github.com/unexpectedjs/unexpected/issues/358).

- How do we increase adoption
 - How do we encouraging new contributors?
 - How do we get better at marketing?
 - How we ease the transition from other library?
 - Blogs?
 - Screencasts?
 - Presentations?
 - List companies using it on website?

- Should we do roadmaps for Unexpected core?

- How can we improve the overall impression of the Unexpected ecosystem?
 - Documentation
 - Backwards compatibility
 - Quality of the error output
 - Performance
 - Examples

- Should we split core up in multiple libraries?
 - types
 - inspection
 - diffs
 - assertion dispatch

- TypeScript
 - it may be possible to automatically build / generate typescript type definitions for the assertions
   (per plugin), is this something we'd look at?

- "Plugins" that require wrapping the top level expect, and thus cannot install
  themselves via the `expect.use`. Discuss and see if we can learn something
  from these experiments:
 - [fixpect](https://github.com/papandreou/fixpect), tries to update the
   expected in the test suite source files so that the tests pass.
   Requires wrapping the top-level `expect` so that it can by try...catched
   and non-oathbroken promises can be gathered.
 - [consider](https://github.com/papandreou/consider), wait for all promises
   in `afterEach` instead of relying on exceptions.
   Requires wrapping the top-level `expect` so that it can by try...catched
   and non-oathbroken promises can be gathered.
 - [uncontemplated](https://github.com/papandreou/uncontemplated), adds support
   for writing assertions inside ES6 template strings. Sort of in a category
   of its own as its API cannot coexist with that of the regular `expect`
   because of the way the "tagged template" function is invoked.
   Requires wrapping the top-level `expect` so that it can turn the template
   into valid `expect` syntax.
 - Unexpected's built-in footgun protection, in case we want to move it into
   an "internal plugin" of sorts, or maybe even move it out of core.

# Hackathon ideas

- Limit the error output of unexpected-react by dotting out subtrees without conflicts.
- Improve the type lookup performance by hardcoding the core type lookup and make compatibility tests.
- Implement codemods to help transitioning from other assertion libraries or test runner built ins
